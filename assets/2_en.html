        Pregnancy is an amazing time in a woman's life. It was also a tense moment when a mysterious new life to grow
        and develop in the womb. Once pregnancy occurs, various effects occur in the female body; both effects due to
        hormonal changes, body shape, as well as the emotional state of women become pregnant.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Along with the growth of the fetus in the womb, emerging signs that indicate pregnancy. In pregnancy, changes
        occur in the entire female body, especially on tools external and internal genitalia, as well as on the breast
        (mammary). This is because the role of somatomamotropine, estrogen, and progesterone hormone in pregnancy.

    <p class="text-justify">
        In addition to physical changes, pregnant women will also experience psychological changes, which are also
        influenced by hormonal changes. These changes interact with internal and factors affecting transition period of
        a pregnant woman to be a mother. Often, we hear a woman saying how happy she was due to be a mother. However,
        not infrequently there are also women who are concerned about pregnancy, worried about losing her beauty, or the
        possibility of the baby is abnormal.

        As a professional, the midwife should perform their role and function properly. It is very important to examine
        changes in the physical and psychological that happened, so that midwives can provide care, support, and help
        addresses the concerns of pregnant women. Therefore, the midwife should encourage pregnant women to antenatal
        check routine (antenatal care). The main purpose of antenatal care is to facilitate healthy and positive
        outcomes for both mother and baby in a way to build a trusting relationship with the mother, early detection of
        complications that can be life-threatening, preparing for the birth, and providing education.
