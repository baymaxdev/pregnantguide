            <li>Calculating the Approximate Delivery Date and Estimated Fetal Weight</li>
        </h4>
        <p>Approximate Delivery Date will use Naegele formula</p>
        <p>Naegele formula: the first day of the last menstrual + 7-3 months = date of birth</p>
        <p>Naegel formula can be used only if the mother menstruate regularly. This formula can not be used if:</p>
        <p>1. Mother has a history of irregular menstruation and menstrual (amenorhoe)</p>
        <p>2. Mother was pregnant while still breastfeeding and have never menstruate again after giving birth</p>
        <p>3. Pregnant women after stop consuming the pill and not menstruating again
            If one of the above situations occur, the approximate date of delivery made clinically (example: by looking
            at the size of the uterus) or by using ultrasound.
        </p>
        <p>Example Usage Naegele formula:</p>
        <p>Starting from the first day of the last menstrual period and add 7 days. Then count backward three months
            Note well, use your fingers or hands and write a paper to make it easier.</p>
        <p>LMP = Last Menstruation Period</p>
        <p>LMP: May 5</p>
        <p>Add 7 days: May 6 + 7 days = May 13</p>
        <p>Counting back three months: 13 April, March 13, February 13</p>
        <p>Approximate Delivery Date are on February 13th in the next year.</p>
        <p>LMP: 30 November</p>
        <p>Add 7 days: 30 November + 7 days = December 7</p>
        <p>Counting back three months: Nov. 7, 7 October, 7 september</p>
        <p>Approximate Delivery Date are on 7th September in the next year.</p>
        <strong>Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW)</strong>

        <p>When the presenting part not yet entered pelvis</p>
        <p>(EFW)= (HUF-12)x155</p>
        <p>When the presenting part has entered the pelvis</p>
        <p>(EFW)= (HUF-11)x155</p>

        <p>Information:</p>
        <p>EFW: Estimated Fetal Weight (g)</p>
        <p>HUF: High Uterine Fundus (cm) measured by metheline</p>
        <p>Example: HUF: 30 cm and the fetal head has not entered pelvis</p>
        <p>EFW= (30-12) x155 = 2790 grams</p>

            <li>Definition of Childbirth Preparation</li>
        </h4>

        <p>a. Childbirth is a plan of action developed by the mother, family members, and midwives.
        </p>
        <p>
            b. This plan does not have to be in writing and usually is not written. This plan is just a discussion to
            ensure that women receive the care she needed.
        </p>
        <p>c. With the birth plan would reduce confusion and chaos at the time of delivery and increases the likelihood
            that the mother will receive appropriate care and timely.

                        maternity homes, while high-risk deliveries to be done in a hospital that has an operating room
